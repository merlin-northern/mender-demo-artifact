Mender Demo Artifact
=============================================

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux
devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as
a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains a demo artifact, which is used during the onboarding process
and acts as an example of the update capabilities.

## Getting started

Build with:

```
docker build --build-arg MENDER_VERSION=none --build-arg MENDER_ARTIFACT_VERSION=none -t mender-demo-artifact .
```

Replace `none` with the relevant versions, and follow the instructions at the end of the build.


### Onboarding Site
 
This site displays system information from the device itself. The device details are populated in the `entrypoint.sh` in the development setup and a similar file should be executed before server start on the updated device.

To see the site, install on a device and visit http://localhost:85. The "Web server" in the top right reflects the container id (instead of a proper server name).
